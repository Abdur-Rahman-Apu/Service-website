                    a strong name for you and your business in the business world. But without branding the above said

                <h1 data-aos=" fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">What is Branding?
                </h1>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">To understand branding we should understand what is meant
                    by brand? A brand is a name or symbol or a letter or term used to define your product. But branding
                    is quite different. Branding is a feeling of an individual when they think about a particular brand.
                    For example, let’s take a dress. There are a hell of a lot of brands available in the world. But
                    when we think about a particular brand’s dress, we have a different kind of feeling. If I put it
                    into exact words, it’s a gut feeling. To make you understand even easier, let’s take ZARA, a famous
                    cloth, and accessory brand. If you think that, the crop top you bought in the last discount sale on
                    Zara is so soft and comfortable, then that is branding.
                </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">When a particular product creates a physical or emotional
                    feeling in you, then it’s branding. A brand can be copied but branding can’t. But branding is not
                    quite easy. It requires time, energy, creativity, innovation, etc., To achieve branding, you’ve to
                    brainstorm with your team. You’ve to work hard to create a positive perception about your company or
                    your product r your service amazon the people. And it consumes more of your energy and brain. </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">
                    When you create that strong perception among your users then it will automatically create brand
                    awareness and you will drive more profit to your business. Nowadays, most people understand the
                    value of branding. So they are creating more and more new new ideas to achieve the name for their
                    brand.
                </p>

            <!-- why branding important  -->
            <div class="why-branding-important">
                <h1 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">Why Branding is Important for your business?
                </h1>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">Branding is a wide area that should be shaped with utmost
                    care. It needs a strategy, a well-planned
                    strategy to mark your brand name on your customer’s heart. Branding creates respect and feeling
                    about your product among the users and you’ve to maintain the same till the end. Here are some of
                    the reasons which I accumulated on why branding is so very very important for your business.</p>

                <ol data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">

                    <li>Branding means recognition.Your business needs that to reach
                        well. Mostly we buy something which has more reach and recognition. And that is it. Branding
                        creates that for your business. </li>

                    <li>
                        It tells your story. Yeah, you read that right. A good branding strategy tells the story of your
                        brand. A good brand will tell the story if you put the words and logos with more consciousness.
                        The customers need to understand about you, your company, your product, and your employees just
                        with your brand and branding.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Branding builds an emotional relationship with the brand. As I already said, the clothes from
                        the brand ZARA are more soft, comfortable, ethnic. That is it. It already created that emotional
                        link between their brand and the person.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Brand and branding build that “loyal customers” for your product. If your brand touched their
                        emotion, then they become your loyal customer and repetitive customer
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Clear branding gives you the pathway to go. It gives you and your employees the direction to
                        take your company. It tells them how to act, how to create, what to create, what the audience is
                        expecting, etc.,
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Your brand motivates you and helps you in staying focused. Sometimes you might feel depressed
                        or you might not know what to do. At that time, as a god angel, your brand will help you,
                        motivate you.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A good branding strategy and a great brand force your customer and audience to spread
                        awareness about your product. More awareness means more consumers, more consumer means more
                        profit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A good brand attracts more highly talented employees, it engages with your employees and forces
                        them to work.
                    </li>


                </ol>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">You should never ignore or underestimate your brand.
                    Always think of your brand as your respect and
                    reputation. Branding is all. A good brand will work even when you’re sleeping. So be soft and caring
                    with your brand. </p>
            </div>

                <h1 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">Common Misconceptions about Branding </h1>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">Mostly, everyone thinks many wrong things about branding.
                    It’s a vague term for everyone including some marketers. Many people have that confusion about
                    branding which can make their whole business at loss. The following are some of the misconceptions
                    you should rethink about the topic “branding” </p>

                <ol data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">
                    <li>
                        <p>Branding and advertising are not the same. Mostly we think both advertising and branding are
                            the same, but it is not. Branding is long-term whereas advertising is short-term.
                            Advertising is persuading the people but branding is creating an opinion about the product.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Branding is for both small businesses and large-scale businesses. Most of us think that
                            branding is only for big companies which is absolutely not true. As I already said, branding
                            creates a gut feeling and that is important for every scale business. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Branding and logo making is not the same. The logo is just a design or symbol or name for the
                            brand. But it is not branding. It’s an important branch of branding but not completely
                            branding. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Spending money on branding will definitely pay you back. But most people think it’s a waste
                            in spending money on branding which is not true.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Branding won’t create on its own. Yeah, you should do strategies to build a successful brand,
                            it won’t come automatically knocking on your door. </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="2000">The above are some of the most common mistakes and
                    misconceptions most of us were doing or thinking about branding. Branding is unique and it’s
                    everything. </p>
