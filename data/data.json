Having been mismanaged for years and left in the dust of other growing entertainment venues in what is certainly one of the entertainment capitals of the world, The Alex Theater was coming back to life. To break back onto the scene, The Alex needed a total re-brand to signal its new chapter and to make a bold visual statement. Verhaal, breaking the common design norm of a single static logo - designed a modular brand identity system that has multiple variations and changes and morphs, reflecting the bold energy of The Alex.",
