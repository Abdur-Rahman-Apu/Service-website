Their current name was hard to pronounce (like “kina” not “china”) and they wanted something unique that projected the creativity and expertise they personify as architects.<br>In partnership with Rachel Zorel at 7 Layer Studio, Verhaal undertook an intensive ideation process, working closely with the founders and developed the name, Idea Space which communicates the new physical spaces they create for their clients to make memories in for themselves and their families. We then designed a minimalistic and tasteful identity that reflected the precision they put into every project - containing a hint of whimsy and a nod to architectural drawings.",
